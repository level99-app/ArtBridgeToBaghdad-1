# artbridgetobaghdad


The Art Bridge is an eCommerce website I made for my mother who's an artist. She is an artist and a painter who sells her artwork in Galleries across the Globe and especially within the United States.

The technologies I used on this project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, Bootstrap, Stripe, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and I deployed the website to Heroku.

The website is https://artbridgetobaghdad.herokuapp.com

While the website is starting to look neat and is functional I am not 100% done with it yet.

I would like to use JWT very soon to make it so admins can login and manage the website.

Afterwards I plan on launching the site with a paid domain name.
